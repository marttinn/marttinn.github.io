Launched [Hacker Talk](http://www.hackertalk.co), created webpages and apps at [SolveIT](http://www.solveit.mx),
currently bootstrapping [Akademio](http://www.tryakademio.com) and in my
spare time I create [‘One MVP a week’](https://medium.com/@mvrtxn/one-mvp-a-week-week-1-c27b633ef7d9#.3qnfrobjn)  
  
I created [Bank Piggy](https://www.bankpiggy.xyz/), an online savings platform. Later I built [Live Feelings](http://www.livefeelings.xyz/) which maps how people are feeling in SF, NY and Mexico City.   Currently I am working on [Lisztomaniacs](http://lisztomaniacs.club/) which allows you to share playlists and have them available in multiple platforms online.
