Launched [Hacker Talk](http://www.hackertalk.co), created webpages and apps at [SolveIT](http://www.solveit.mx),
currently bootstrapping [Akademio](http://www.tryakademio.com) and in my
spare time I create [‘One MVP a week’](https://medium.com/@mvrtxn/one-mvp-a-week-week-1-c27b633ef7d9#.3qnfrobjn)  
  
I created [Bank piggy](https://www.bankpiggy.xyz/) which allows you to save online. Then I built [Live feelings](http://www.livefeelings.xyz/) which show how are people feeling in SF, NY and Mexico City.   Currently I am developing [Lisztomaniacs](http://lisztomaniacs.club/) which allows you to share playlists and have them available in multiple platforms.
